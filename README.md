An app I made for my aunt who's a dentist for easier patient management (she used to use a notebook lmao)

there's a lot of stuff here - patient management, calendar, payment management (manual and cash-based lmao not doing stripe for ts - but useful to know who owes you stuff if you're a romanian dentist), it's also in romanian bc Imma probably give it to some actual dentists here except my aunt
